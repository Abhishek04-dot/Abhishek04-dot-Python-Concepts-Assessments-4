# Task 1
- Opens sample.txt in read/write mode (r+).
- Reads and prints the file content.
- Closes the file after reading (good practice).
- Handles missing file errors gracefully using try-except.

# Task 2
- Accepts user input and writes it to output.txt.
- Ignores input if it is a number only (using .isdigit()).
- Appends new user input to the same file.
- Reads and prints the final content of output.txt.
- Uses try-except to handle missing file errors gracefully.
